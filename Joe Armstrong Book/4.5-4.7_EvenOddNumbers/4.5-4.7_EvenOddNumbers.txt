5. Write a module called math_functions.erl, exporting the functions even/1 and
odd/1. The function even(X) should return true if X is an even integer and
otherwise false. odd(X) should return true if X is an odd integer.

6. Add a higher-order function to math_functions.erl called filter(F, L), which returns
all the elements X in L for which F(X) is true.

7. Add a function split(L) to math_functions.erl, which returns {Even, Odd} where
Even is a list of all the even numbers in L and Odd is a list of all the odd
numbers in L. Write this function in two different ways using accumulators
and using the function filter you wrote in the previous exercise.

Output:

even(4): true
even(3): false
odd(4): false
odd(3): true
filter([1,2,3,4,5]): [2,4]
split([1,2,3,4,5]): {[1,3,5],[2,4]}
accSplit([1,2,3,4,5]): {[1,3,5],[2,4]}
