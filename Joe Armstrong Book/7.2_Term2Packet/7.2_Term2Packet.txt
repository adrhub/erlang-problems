2. Write a function term_to_packet(Term) -> Packet that returns a binary consisting
of a 4-byte length header N followed by N bytes of data produced by calling
term_to_binary(Term).

3. Write the inverse function packet_to_term(Packet) ->Ter m that is the inverse of
the previous function.

4. Write some tests in the style of Adding Tests to Your Code, on page 46, to
test that the previous two functions can correctly encode terms into
packets and recover the original terms by decoding the packets.
